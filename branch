Explain what a branch is, in your own words

A branch is like a fork in the edit timeline of a repository.  Edits made AFTER the fork do not affect the other branch.  

So in the example of this exercise, working on the "answers" branch does not affect the "questions" branch.  If we were to switch branches (using checkout <branch>) we would see that these files contain only the questions, and not the answers.
