Explain what the 'upstream' remote is usually used for, in your own words

The term 'upstream remote' usually refers to the repository from which the cloned repository originates.

So in this exercise, the upstream remote is the repository hosted on Github.  The downstream repo is on my computer and pulls from the upstream -Github- repo, and when I've finished making my changes I'll push my commits back upstream to the repository on Github.
